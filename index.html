            <h2>Dear Aryan Roy,</h2>
            <p>
                You always say I need to study more, so I coded something for you,
                again! It's not much (I should've started on this earlier lol) but
                I really hope you do like it (so many bugs... so so many bugs). 
                THANK YOU CHATGPT! Your CMU CS Major made a Github Website!<br><br>
                Anyway, happy one year! Can you believe it's been a whole year already? 
                It feels like just yesterday when we first met, yet it also feels like a 
                lifetime ago. Reflecting on the past year fills me with an overwhelming 
                sense of gratitude for having you by my side through it all. Every moment 
                spent with you has been a treasure, and I am so incredibly lucky to have you 
                in my life.<br><br>
                I love you more than words can express, Aryan. You've been my rock, my 
                best friend, and my source of endless joy. From the laughter-filled days to 
                even the hard times from long-distance, you have made my life better every 
                single step of the way.<br><br>
                First, I want to thank you for your unwavering support and love that you've 
                always given me. You've stood by me through the highs and lows (CMU CS and 
                Akshita Upadhyay), being my biggest cheerleader through everything. Thank you 
                for all the advice and helping me through everything.<br><br>
                Aryan Roy, you are truly one of a kind. Your kindness, intelligence, and 
                incredible sense of humor never fail to amaze me. I cherish every moment 
                we've shared together, from our late-night facetimes to our adventures 
                everywhere. With you, every day is an adventure, and I can't wait to see 
                what the future holds for us.<br><br>
                As we celebrate this our one year, I'm incredibly excited for the years to 
                come. Together, we've created countless memories that I will forever hold 
                dear to my heart. From our first date to our shared dreams of the future, 
                every moment with you has been a gift.<br><br>
                Here's to many more years of laughter, love, and adventures together. I love 
                you more than words can express, Aryan Roy, and I am so grateful to have you 
                as my boyfriend.<br><br>
                You are my everything, and I will always cherish the bond we share.<br><br>
                Thank you for being the most amazing partner anyone could ask for. I love
                 you more than you'll ever know, and I look forward to spending the rest of 
                 my life by your side.<br><br>
                Yours forever,<br><br>
                Tanishqa Puhan Roy</i></p>
